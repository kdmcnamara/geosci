    <h3>
<br>Scientific / Engineering Challenges:<br><br>
Technical challenges with the process of recycling are not hard to come by, after the
materials arrive at the recycling facility numerous technological challenges take place before it
can be shipped out as raw material. Most of the challenges stem from sorting the materials out
effetely.
As there is profits to be made in recycling, many innovations have solved numerous
challenges. But as the industry is privatized, each facility is not identical, and thus not all
locations have the same capabilities.
According to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States
generated about 258 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2014. However, 34.6% of
municipal solid waste (MSW) was recovered through recycling (EPA, n.d.). MSW contains
materials such as plastic, steel, tires, glass, foam, and other non-biodegradable products, which
have been mass-produced over the past decades. These materials can persist in the environment
for centuries if not millennia due to their durability, ultimately causing waste-management issues
and environmental damage.</h3>

    <h3><br>Sorting and the challenges that follow:<br><br>It is imperative for recycling to be done mainly by automation in order to allow for
expansion, cost effectiveness and reliability in the future (Ruj, 2015). Yet many facilities cannot
preform full automation due to numerous challenges with sorting material. Many facilities face
issues with users sorting incorrectly, the fallowing videos explore three recycling facilities with
unique automation systems and challenges: <br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YaTpL8nl7c">Boulder County</a><br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Tr-U0nALM">London, Ontario</a><br><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9rXCPlRF78">Mtm Plastics</a><br><br>
One such scenario that makes automation so challenging is sorting Low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) from Polypropylene (PP). The two plastics have nearly identical densities,
are used frequently and make up nearly 50% of the U.S.’s plastic waste (Vanderbilt, 2004).
Plastic film, such as plastic bags, is another challenge for the recycling process. Due to
the flexibility of this material, they can wreak havoc on the sorting cycle and damage equipment.
Therefore though the material itself is recyclable, for municipal use plastic films are considered a
non-recyclable material. The fallowing video and article illustrate the issue in action.

Chicago Tribune: Plastic bags a headache for recyclers<br><br>

Altogether plastics pose many difficult challenges for the sorting and refinement process
there are many different material variations that must be sorted in order to create an adequate
process (Hopewell, et al. 2009). Hopewell’s paper Plastics recycling: challenges and
opportunities refines these complex scientific challenges, a link is included in the references.
Innovation in automation behind recycling is growing exponentially showing lots of
potential for profits in the market. Automation in recycling is a difficult problem but is sure to
attract gifted minds that will sustain its importance in the future.</h3>
