    <h1>Brief History of Recycling</h1>
  </div>
 <div class="circleHistory">
    <h3>Both citizens of Wisconsin and the state’s government have worked diligently since recycling
started in World War II to make sure the state actively participates in reusing materials.
Wisconsin has continuously set the bar high for fellow states to watch their waste by passing
regulations and improving current processes. While recycling’s initial purpose was to help
produce materials in a time of world-wide war, today it is a very beneficial way to reduce and
reuse the accumulation of inorganic waste. Wisconsin understood early on that recycling not
only has a positive environmental impact, but can also be further incentivized to help simulate
the economy. It is for those reasons that almost 1.7 million tons of materials are kept out of
Wisconsin landfills and incinerators (https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Recycling/Facts.html). However,
there is an extensive and ever-evolving process that the materials go through to ensure they
are kept out of the dumps.</h3>

    <h3>The process of recycling in Madison begins with sorting and compiling materials in recycling
bins, which are then brought to municipal salvaging centers. The items are loaded on a belt
which employees then pick non-recyclable items from. Many people fail to realize that bottles
with liquid still in them cannot be recycled; rather, people should empty and clean their bottles
and cans before recycling them to expedite the process. After employees are done picking
directly from the piles, the items are separated into fields based on their raw material
(aluminums in one pile, plastic in another, etc). These piles are then transported to another
facility that specializes in cleaning, preparing and reusing that material. After being recycled, an
aluminum cans be turned into a new can in just six months.

While the
timing varies greatly based on the material and its future purpose, this entire process is still far
quicker than the amount of time it would take for these materials to decompose in a landfill.</h3>

    <h3>It is so important that Wisconsin citizens continue to participate in the recycling process. While
the average United States citizen recycles 1.7 pounds of their total trash each day, the average
Wisconsinite recycles about 1.9 pounds. <br><br><a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Recycling/Facts.html">https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Recycling/Facts.html</a><br><br>
Hopefully as the recycling process is improved through more regulations and advances in
technology, that number will continue to grow as well.</h3>
